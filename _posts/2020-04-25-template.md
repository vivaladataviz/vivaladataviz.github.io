Just add any content here. This is done using markdown but you can throw in html and js if needed.

For the categories there's essentially 3:
- article
- talk
- project

and you may add the category
- fav 
to have it be displayed in the main pages "vivaladataviz.com/articles" or /talks or /projects 

That's pretty much it.

Not every post has to have images but it's nice. just throw them in `assets/images/` and throw the name in the metadata of the post

`title` and `desc` don't *need* to use quotations but it helps in case you have special chars.
