# THIS IS ALL _BORROWED_ FROM LISA CHARLOTTE ROST'S PERSONAL BLOG & PORTFOLIO 
<http://lisacharlotterost.de>


Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- `_posts` contains every page that's published.
- `_drafts+` contains all articles that are unpublished. Mostly articles I started writing and never finished.
- `pic` contains all images.

---

- `_data` just contains the site = menu structure
- `_includes` contains snippets; most importantly the sidebar and the head part of each page (incl. twitter settings).
- `_layouts` contains page layouts, e.g. the layout for external links.
- `_sass` contains the CSS.
- `_site` contains the rendered site; it's content should never be changed.


Thanks to [Jonathan Muth](https://twitter.com/jonathanmuth) for his help with building the website – especially the super-custom home-baked cookie warning couldn't have happened without him.
